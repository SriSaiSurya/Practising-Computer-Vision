This section contains algorithms for Image Processing which includes 
1. Conversion of an Indexed image 
2. Gray scale image 
3. RGB histograms
4. Threshold images
5. Edge Detection operators such as Sobel and Canny Operators.

And also algorithms for recognising the shapes (Rectangle, Square and Circle) from a given image.
